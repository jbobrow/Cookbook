## Data Storage Details

### File Structure

**iCloud Drive Path:**
```
iCloud Drive/Cookbook/Cookbooks/
├── [CookbookID-1]/
│   ├── cookbook.json           # Cookbook metadata
│   ├── categories.json         # Category definitions
│   └── Recipes/
│       ├── [RecipeID-1].json
│       ├── [RecipeID-2].json
│       └── [RecipeID-3].json
└── [CookbookID-2]/
    ├── cookbook.json
    ├── categories.json
    └── Recipes/
        └── ...
```

**Local Storage Path:**
```
Documents/Cookbooks/
└── (same structure as above)
```

### Storage Options

**iCloud Drive (Default):**
- Automatic synchronization across all your devices
- Files visible in the Cookbook folder in iCloud Drive
- Changes propagate when devices are online
- External file changes are detected and reloaded
- Conflicts handled by last-write-wins

**Local Storage:**
- Device-only storage
- No internet connection required
- Faster file operations
- Manual backup required
- Option available during setup or in settings

### File Access

The Cookbook folder is made visible in iCloud Drive, allowing you to:
- Access recipe files directly from Finder/Files app
- Back up files manually
- Share files with other apps
- Edit JSON files externally (changes are detected)

### Data Format

All data is stored as JSON:
- **cookbook.json**: Cookbook metadata (ID, name, dates)
- **categories.json**: Array of categories with colors
- **[RecipeID].json**: Individual recipe data with ingredients, directions, etc.

## Customization

### Changing Colors
The app uses the system accent color by default. To customize:
1. Open `Assets.xcassets`
2. Add a new "Color Set" named "AccentColor"
3. Set your preferred color

### Modifying Time Increments
In `RecipeEditView.swift`, adjust the time picker increments:
```swift
ForEach(0..<60, id: \.self) { minute in
    if minute % 5 == 0 {  // Change this for different increments
        Text("\(minute)m").tag(minute)
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### iCloud Not Available
1. The app will show the iCloud Setup screen if iCloud isn't detected
2. Follow the on-screen instructions for your platform
3. Alternatively, choose "Use Local Storage" to continue without iCloud
4. You can always enable iCloud later in settings

### iCloud Not Syncing
1. Verify iCloud Drive is enabled in System Settings
2. Check that you're signed in with an Apple ID
3. Ensure iCloud Drive has sufficient storage
4. Check internet connection
5. Force quit and restart the app
6. Check iCloud sync status in System Settings

### Recipes Not Appearing
1. Make sure you're viewing the correct cookbook
2. Check if search is active (clear search bar)
3. Force reload by switching cookbooks and back
4. Check that recipe files exist in the Cookbook folder

### Photos Not Showing
1. Grant photo library permissions when prompted
2. Check that image data is being properly encoded
3. Verify file sizes aren't too large (images stored as base64)
4. Try re-adding the photo

### Categories Not Working
1. Categories are per-cookbook - switch to the right cookbook
2. Check categories.json file in the cookbook folder
3. Deleted categories are automatically unassigned from recipes
4. Try recreating the category if it's corrupted

### Import/Export Issues
1. Ensure files have correct extensions (.cookbook.json or .cookbook)
2. Check that JSON files are valid
3. Verify file isn't corrupted
4. Check console logs for specific import errors

## Current Feature Highlights
